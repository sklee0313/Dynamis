# The Overlapping Finite Element Method 

The Overlapping Finite Element Method (OFEM) is a modern finite element method utilizing the partition of unity (PU) on traditional meshes. Unlike conventional PU-based methods that use low-order finite element functions, the OFEM employs novel cubic PU functions that enable stable polynomial enrichments.
